The Data Science Application Development (DSAD) team develops, operates, and maintains a suite of document classification and data intelligence web services that power data-driven applications for both job seekers and job posters across CareerBuilder. Within CareerBuilder's SOA ecosystem, DSAD functions as a service provider to customer-facing product teams and back-end data processing teams. The team collaborates closely with the Data Science R&D team to transform their research into consumable APIs. From geocoding and job title classification to resume parsing, skills extraction and more, the data enrichment services we provide are core to nearly every major CareerBuilder product and represent a key market differentiator for the business. As a key service provider for numerous downstream customers throughout the department, the DSAD team places a strong emphasis on speed and reliability of our services. Many of our services average 20ms response time or less and we're working toward achieving 99.9% success rates across our platform. We run our APIs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and leverage tools such as NewRelic, Jenkins, and Terraform for application monitoring, and multi-region automated deployments.
